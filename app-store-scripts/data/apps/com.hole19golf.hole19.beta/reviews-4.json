Right now and here is why. When you initially start playing this game you get joy and satisfaction of winning. Usually you can win the game you are playing after a few tries without buying anything to help you win.  The games start getting harder, then harder and you find that you have to start buying help to win.  You are not spending much so it’s ok.  Now I am attempting to win even harder games and it becomes very frustrating and not fun at all.  You are spending more to help you win.  Finally after spending over $100.00 a month trying to win and move up I have had enough. I am spending about $130.00 a month now and I still can not win game 3694 so I am stuck playing the same game while paying more and more.  I am moving to other games that are fun and free.  Candy Crush is no longer fun.  It is stressful and not enjoyable anymore.  \n.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5115494653","userName":"Bonita👩‍🦰","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id964639875","version":"1.163.0","score":5,"title":"Felicidades","text":"Excelente relaja te","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5115494098","userName":"sandacooter","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id648944614","version":"1.163.0","score":2,"title":"Help","text":"Lost game can’t get it back.

No one will play the thousands upon thousands of levels the game has. Sometimes it's nice to have the satisfaction of finishing a game but no one humane is doing all those levels\n\n2- There is this weird glitch for me where the game just randomly makes moves for me and ends up losing for me. It's stupid\n\n3- Candy Crush isn't anything original. I can go play another game like it and have more enjoyment there. Candy Crush is just the lucky app that the public recognizes.\n\n4- A few years ago I played this game a lot and I had used my email to save my progress. Two years later I re-downladed the game again and signed in with my email (same email as before) and it said that the game was unfamiliar with this type of email.\n\n5- When I am playing with four bars and good wifi the game claims that I am \"Not Connected\" so that ends up pausing things up for me.\n\n6- When using the prize wheel, I get the same thing every time. Which just so happened to be the worst thing. The game practically goes out of its way to give you bad prizes. Yet another bad aspect of the game.\n\n7- The game is very repetitive and I could find myself basically playing the same level over and over and over again. The game needs originality instead of making hundreds of copies of one level\n\n8- In many cases, it's the games job. No not job, purpose to force you into spending lots of money on in app purchases. I myself have avoided that but many of my friends have spent hundreds of dollars on completing a level just because the game didn't give enough options and forced them to spend there money. It's quite sad.\n\nLong story short, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5111864225","userName":"Scout070618","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id370883249","version":"1.163.0","score":1,"title":"Love the game - get rid of the hints already","text":"I love this game - can’t take more than 10 minutes because of those annoying hints - seriously at a minimum - give an option to turn them off.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5111725143","userName":"Playrrrr","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id304280226","version":"1.163.0","score":5,"title":"Too Sweet!","text":"This classic game never gets old!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5111046089","userName":"Idk1313","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id125709276","version":"1.163.0","score":1,"title":"Terrible Update!!!","text":"Update was to make improvements and a better game??

Also when your friends are stuck on a level you should have it where you can get help once a day or 3 days or even a week. So you send them a help request and when they accept they play your level you’re stuck on and it uses one of your lives or you can have it use no lives. Also you can send lives through the social space. Also can you have an arrow or like a level guide on the side so you can go to the bottom easier bc it’s a tedious thing to send lives to people without them asking or maybe you do that so we won’t do that I’m not sure.
