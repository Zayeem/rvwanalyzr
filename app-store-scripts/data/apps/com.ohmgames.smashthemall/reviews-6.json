It is very simple and easy to master but something about “cleaning” everything off the level is very satisfying. It does contain ads in between levels but that’s to be expected on a free game. At least the ads are skipable after a couple of seconds. \n\nThen they released the 1.7 update. This update added a store where you could by different skins for your character. No problem with that, earning in game currency is easy. \n\nThe thing that breaks the game, and I’m uninstalling it after this review, is that they’ve now put ads in the middle of the level. Not just before or after a level, but actually in the MIDDLE OF GAMEPLAY. You’ll be moving along clearing enemies and suddenly the screen will start playing a video. You switch tilt your phone sideways and wait for the X to appear to close the ad. Then you’re dropped back into gameplay just in time to see your character fall off a cliff. But don’t worry! You can just watch ANOTHER ad to save your progress!\n\nI have no problem with ads in a free game. I can either endure it or pay to remove them. My choice. But these ads completely break the game. Your serene little sweeping expedition keeps getting interrupted by jarring ads that get you killed. \n\nDon’t bother. Don’t download.
