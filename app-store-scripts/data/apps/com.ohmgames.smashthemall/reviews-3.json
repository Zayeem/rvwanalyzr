This is a fun game that literally is designed to force you to pay to stop the ads. We all expect ads in between levels of free games. Breaking in with ads mid level, sometimes even more than once mid level, is a new one though. It’s so interruptive of game play that you either quit or pay for the no ads purchase. Okay, no big deal, you say. BUT there’s also no way to link the game via Facebook or anything else. So it’s trying to force me to pay a second time to stop ads on my iPad even though I already paid on my iPhone for the app. This is just beyond absurd even in the land of ads that apps have become.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1479551182&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5253484017","userName":"gfjfhh","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id572913377","version":"1.7","score":2,"title":"Bad game","text":"Bad game","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1479551182&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5253458919","userName":"kingbrd","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id33455305","version":"1.7","score":2,"title":"Fun, but...","text":"Addictive, but ads several times in a single round.
