Online mini games (Example - whoever forges the bests swordfish I gets 1st-1st place gets the most money, and 3rd gets the least.\n3.) New upgrade for mining (This upgrade will allow you to get better ores out of rocks so you are not constantly getting bad ores) \n4.) Bank (Useless swords can go in here with a max capacity of about 3-5, and after a while they can sell for more when they are scrapped)\n\nI think these are some great suggestions, and I‚Äôm sure many people would agree!
