I guess I don't get it. But I still try to earn them. Maybe someday I'll figure out what it's good for. \n\nI'm still playing. There is hope at the end of the candy rainbow. Except for now, I'm playing to finish in one try so I can collect gold crowns so I can collect enough gold crowns to make a super crown? This makes no sense. \n\nI'm not so sure about others, but I've gotten to the point of ick. Level 1892 is ridiculous. The wrapped candies all blow up before you can set them up for a swap. üëéüèº \n\nPlease switch up the ads you play. I‚Äôve seen enough of the same 30 second Kohl‚Äôs ad in the past few days to ensure I will never go to Kohl‚Äôs again. Seriously. 10 seconds is long enough (although too long) to watch the ads. Plus, I‚Äôve just hit three hard or super hard levels in a row. Ease up. Relaxation is my (and many others‚Äô) point of this game.\n\nFirst of all, READ your reviews. I swear you have deleted mine. I'm pretty sure that I've written and updated the review several times, but now I have to start a new one ü§î so this might sound quite cynical. \n\nI think you guys have gotten big heads over the success of your games. You are taking a lot of the fun out of almost every aspect of the game. When one is on a roll, the videos for free boosters come up in just about everything, (and I watch them) but when one needs the help, it isn't there. The number of moves on some levels have been cut, the boosters are less and less frequent, and the things to buy have pretty much taken over the game. Work to earn your coins/gold bar or beat your levels, just to see that in order to redeem them, you have to pay? I kind of thought that what was earned is earned, not bought. When you have not completed a level, the option is there to win moves, but in my experience that is rare. When I have a chance to win moves, as the entices say, I want to win moves, not double fish. The gold bar prizes are what I would consider chintzy. Win the whole episode and get 5 gold bars. Yay. I am in a nightmarishly impossible level, and have been for quite some time. Seriously, 18 moves for removing 18 double loaded jellies? Yeah, that's not even a good algorithm. \n    \nWhat used to be just a pleasant distraction, has now become pretty frustrating, and in reading reviews, you're not getting new players, your most loyal customers are leaving you.
