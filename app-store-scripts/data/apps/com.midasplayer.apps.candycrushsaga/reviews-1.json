While it is free, King will allow you to have several easy or fun levels, then they will make it impossible to get through a level without boosters, prompting you to purchase. \nThey apparently have an algorithm which will only allow you to pass a level when they decide you‚Äôre either not going to pay, or have stayed long enough to suit them. Here‚Äôs an example: there is a booster wheel with 8-10 items that can be spun daily for a chance to win boosters to help in the game. One item on the wheel is ‚ÄúJackpot‚Äù. I‚Äôve been playing for years (level 4700+) and have never landed on ‚ÄúJackpot‚Äù. I‚Äôve landed hundreds of time on the other choices, but never Jackpot. That is statistically impossible. The algorithm refuses to allow it. Many others complain of the same thing. \nJust saying, if you‚Äôre not a player already, I highly recommend you remain that way.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5191512670","userName":"lorricary","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id590774896","version":"1.164.0","score":5,"title":"Lorricary","text":"Game is better third time around","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5191343299","userName":"sandyvp","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id176218283","version":"1.164.0","score":5,"title":"Addictive","text":"Had no idea when everyone was taking about this game how addicting it can become.

I played a lot a few years ago and then got back into it and have been playing constantly for a little over a year now. A few thing that have bothered me are that sometimes there is a glitch when you beat a level and click next on the pop up it sometimes brings you to the same level again and you have to waste a life on it even though you already beat it.. another thing is why can you only use certain power ups on certain levels? For example I was stuck on level 2000 something and I did the daily spin and won a fish power up however the level I‚Äôve been stuck on doesn‚Äôt allow me to use it which is super frustrating. I also agree with other reviews that there is no point in having a jackpot panel on the spinner if no one ever lands on it, I‚Äôve been playing for years now and have never landed on jackpot. Lastly, I have a friend who has the candy crush up but barely plays and she was explaining how every time she plays she gets a bunch of power ups saying something along the lines of ‚Äúwelcome back‚Äù or ‚Äúwe missed you‚Äù. I understand the concept of this but it‚Äôs very frustrating when I play the game every day and don‚Äôt get any random power ups or rewards for being a loyal player but someone who plays once a month gets several power ups everytime they play... if you can‚Äôt tell, this game takes up too much of my life but I‚Äôm obsessed.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5190071033","userName":"daffy1108","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41024833","version":"1.164.0","score":1,"title":"Deleted benefit feature","text":"With latest update this fun game is no longer fun or challenging.
