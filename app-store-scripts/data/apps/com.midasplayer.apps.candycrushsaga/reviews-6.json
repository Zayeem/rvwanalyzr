There are a ton of levels, both easy and hard, so it‚Äôs never boring. There is one problem I have. If you buy something with gold there isn‚Äôt a confirmation or anything. It unjust goes through immediately when you push what you want to buy. This has really hurt me. I was out of hearts so the no more lives notification came on the screen. Underneath it was the options to buy unlimited lives for a certain amount of time. I didn‚Äôt know this notification came up because I was in autopilot and just clicked the place where the play button normally was. Apparently on the no lives screen that is the option to spend 60 gold on 6 hours of unlimited lives. I accidentally spent 60 gold on something that I wouldn‚Äôt even enjoy considering I‚Äôm going to sleep in less than an hour. Add a confirmation button or something so no one accidentally buys something. Other than that I really love the game.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5075749471","userName":"money_marcus","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id328298681","version":"1.162.1","score":4,"title":"Cool","text":"It‚Äôs cool","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5075667177","userName":"lala confused","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id428459460","version":"1.162.1","score":3,"title":"Having trouble","text":"I‚Äôve been playing this game for years and the past few months it‚Äôs been taking away things I worked hard to get and now it‚Äôs not letting me watch videos to get extra things or more moves.

The developers are still greedy in that,1) it still takes 2-1/2 hours to load up five lives, which means any treats/boosters with a timer will expire before your next life in 30 minutes. And, 2) that brings up another asinine bit; if I get a color bomb with a timer, that booster is not showing on my current level...or the next...or the next. So, how the hell am I supposed to use this timed booster if it‚Äôs never an option???? \n\nEvery app game has its quirks, but this one tops them all.
