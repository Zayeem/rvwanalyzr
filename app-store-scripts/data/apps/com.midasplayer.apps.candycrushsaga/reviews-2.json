Best I‚Äôve seen of this type of game.  But it has one major drawback: timebombs.  What good does it do to have 20 moves when the game drops 20 timebombs with a 14 move countdown?   Or worse, if it drops a single bomb with a 2-move countdown and absolutely no way for the player to counteract it?  This does not promote game enjoyment.   If not for that, the game would be just about perfect.  But the timebombs are both too many and too short-lived... if even necessary to game play.  I consider them a detriment to game function.
