In the beginning, it was a slick, solid, clever game that was immediately addictive. But over the last few years it has become a bloated, confusing mess, with a non-sensical number of challenges that you cannot opt out of, and requiring an ever-increasing number of clicks to progress from the end of one game to the beginning of the next.  The developers are clearly focused on manipulating the rules and supposed ‚Äúrandom‚Äù elements of the game (e.g. the end of game wheel spin for additional moves, or the daily booster wheel spin) to drive increased in-app purchases.  The nail in the coffin for me was the recent decision to eliminate the ability to restart a game without penalty prior to making your first move.  I now continually burn boosters that get placed in unusable spots, as I cannot reshuffle the board without losing a life. This makes the game unplayable at higher levels, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money on booster purchases. \n\nI am done.  I will now move on to other games.

I‚Äôve played for so many years and love most of the new changes. My color bombs explode when something else goes off and it‚Äôs not even close to the bomb. Ugh I can handle some changes.... but this losing a life when you exit the board and didn‚Äôt make any moves is just not cool. This might be the end of it for me.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5243618060","userName":"yerrrrx","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1096991258","version":"1.165.2","score":1,"title":"THE NEW UPDATE IS TRASH","text":"Please bring back the option of leaving the game from the beginning without losing lives, I‚Äôm at level 3,000 and these levels are really hard to pass, at least knowing how the board looked like before the game helped me to make it this far, so if you don‚Äôt fix this new update I‚Äôll simply stop playing since there is no point of paying for boosters or getting them as you advance in levels if you can‚Äôt choose how to distribute them by leaving and entering again. Hope you‚Äôll realize this will decrease not only your users but also your sales since there‚Äôs no point in buying boosters if we don‚Äôt get to choose how they‚Äôre distributed.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5243568115","userName":"sbq112","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id336484015","version":"1.165.2","score":1,"title":"Trashhhh","text":"Why!?
