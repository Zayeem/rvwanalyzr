I did and agreed that it was improved.  Been sick so not played for a week & played today and now I find that I cannot look at a level without losing my latest upgrade on boosters!!  Cannot believe that they have changed that!  I like to look to see what the level requirements are before selecting from my boosters!  It is very irritating that this has been changed after years of it not being a loss of boosters if I exit! \n\nI updated and now I am losing lives, 20 lives so far, every time it crashes which is frequently!!!  Does anyone test before releasing updates?\n\nPREVIOUS UPDATE:  Liked the game but has too many quirks!  Lose friend emails, sending requests for lives touch one friend and get multiple due to sensitivity.  Been stuck this level for three weeks but do not receive the 3 extra shots but am constantly prompted to send for other friends stuck.  Then hear from friends this new feature does not work!  No surprise considering all the other issues!  I am with the others on this, way too many pleasurable games to play out there, why deal with the frustration!
