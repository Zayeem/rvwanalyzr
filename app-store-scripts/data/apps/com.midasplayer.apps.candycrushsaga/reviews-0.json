Not the new changes!!","text":"I play this game every day to unwind but this new update has brought a lot of changes that I feel being the game really down. There used to be opportunities to watch an ad for a couple seconds and then get a reward. Either a life or a booster. I don’t understand why you got rid of this, the ad was always short with the rare occasion of one lasting 10 seconds. \nThe next thing that has gone away is the level boosters. For each level you won the first time playing you got a booster and you’d get more each level. Then when you’d lose you’d only lose one booster at a time. This was always fun and really helped when you didn’t have any boosters to use. I’m not sure why these things were taken away. I keep getting stuck on levels and playing them endlessly waiting to open another treasure box hoping that I will get a booster that will help me beat the level. \nThe only thing that has changed that I like is now you can chose when to claim the treasure after collecting the special candies. It’s nice that if you don’t have anymore lives you can wait until you have more to open it because most of the time the boosters have a time limit of 15 minutes. \nI’m hoping the game has a few bugs to be worked out after the update and things will go back to the way they were soon. If not I don’t know how much longer I can keep playing. I’m not completely levels like I used to, so what’s the point really. It’s frustrating to play the same level 100 with nothing to show from it. Now I’ve read that other people no longer can back out of the board without losing a life, I never knew that was a thing but I wish I had!! So bring it back!!\nPlease please fix it!!!

I took the plunge and deleted the game after King went on their latest money grab, by taking both lives and boosters when a player closes a game without making a move.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5261075953","userName":"YouWon'tLetMe","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id166278703","version":"1.165.2","score":1,"title":"You asked for it","text":"Yes it's aggravating to be constantly asked to rate your game....and now that I've played it here are a few of my comments. Oh, by the way, I'd be playing it now but \"you\" won't let me because I won't connect to  Facebook or pay real  $$$  for \"lives\"! This game appears to be programmed to drop candies in such an order that it appears \" unnatural\" but totally works toward NOT letting you do good or win I have played lots of matching games and something's not right with this one. Delete!\n\nDec. 2019\nAre you all really that STUPID? You advertise this game as STRESS REDUCING but then you give so few moves for very difficult games and make it agonizing to try to play! I’d have thought that you would want good POSITIVE reviews but guess what.. I was wrong.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5260708639","userName":"HarllyScofiey","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1108564652","version":"1.165.2","score":5,"title":"💛💛💛","text":"We should be getting money on this game like a real money lol it’s interesting tho","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5260686538","userName":"Ro46bf9","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id665675307","version":"1.165.2","score":5,"title":"Concentration.","text":"Is Wonderful Game","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"}]
