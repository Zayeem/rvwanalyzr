It had become boring. I started playing again about 6 months ago. I like the new changes & updates to the game but developers...WHAT is the PURPOSE of the crowns???? One objective is to get boosters. The crowns offer NOTHING but confetti. POINTLESS!! Give us crowns WITH free boosters  for completing so many levels on the first try! Additionally, TWICE I‚Äôve come in 2nd place for the weekly race these past 2 weeks and didn‚Äôt get my prizes! The race ends without warning & a new race begins. But NO PRIZES! According to the race rules, the top 3 places get prizes! Additionally, why does the game take my black balls WITHOUT a stripe or candy bomb nearby?? That‚Äôs CHEATING!! Then the hard, harder, hardest levels come so close together, that there‚Äôs little opportunity to move ahead in the race once reaching the 2,000 levels. While the competition is ok, it seems that you‚Äôve forgotten that SOME ADULTS play the game to relax & as a pass time. It should‚Äôve cause frustration because you‚Äôre trying to force players to make booster purchases. We‚Äôre adults, not kids wanting to spend countless hours trying to get through one level of a game. Our lives consist of more than time on a game.
