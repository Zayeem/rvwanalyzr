It had become boring. I started playing again about 6 months ago. I like the new changes & updates to the game but developers...WHAT is the PURPOSE of the crowns???? One objective is to get boosters. The crowns offer NOTHING but confetti. POINTLESS!! Give us crowns WITH free boosters  for completing so many levels on the first try! Additionally, TWICE I‚Äôve come in 2nd place for the weekly race these past 2 weeks and didn‚Äôt get my prizes! The race ends without warning & a new race begins. But NO PRIZES! According to the race rules, the top 3 places get prizes! Additionally, why does the game take my black balls WITHOUT a stripe or candy bomb nearby?? That‚Äôs CHEATING!! Then the hard, harder, hardest levels come so close together, that there‚Äôs little opportunity to move ahead in the race once reaching the 2,000 levels. While the competition is ok, it seems that you‚Äôve forgotten that SOME ADULTS play the game to relax & as a pass time. It should‚Äôve cause frustration because you‚Äôre trying to force players to make booster purchases. We‚Äôre adults, not kids wanting to spend countless hours trying to get through one level of a game. Our lives consist of more than time on a game.

Here‚Äôs an example: there is a booster wheel with 8-10 items that can be spun daily for a chance to win boosters to help in the game. One item on the wheel is ‚ÄúJackpot‚Äù. I‚Äôve been playing for years (level 4700+) and have never landed on ‚ÄúJackpot‚Äù. I‚Äôve landed hundreds of time on the other choices, but never Jackpot. That is statistically impossible.

I played a lot a few years ago and then got back into it and have been playing constantly for a little over a year now. A few thing that have bothered me are that sometimes there is a glitch when you beat a level and click next on the pop up it sometimes brings you to the same level again and you have to waste a life on it even though you already beat it.. another thing is why can you only use certain power ups on certain levels? For example I was stuck on level 2000 something and I did the daily spin and won a fish power up however the level I‚Äôve been stuck on doesn‚Äôt allow me to use it which is super frustrating. I also agree with other reviews that there is no point in having a jackpot panel on the spinner if no one ever lands on it, I‚Äôve been playing for years now and have never landed on jackpot. Lastly, I have a friend who has the candy crush up but barely plays and she was explaining how every time she plays she gets a bunch of power ups saying something along the lines of ‚Äúwelcome back‚Äù or ‚Äúwe missed you‚Äù. I understand the concept of this but it‚Äôs very frustrating when I play the game every day and don‚Äôt get any random power ups or rewards for being a loyal player but someone who plays once a month gets several power ups everytime they play... if you can‚Äôt tell, this game takes up too much of my life but I‚Äôm obsessed.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=553834731&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5190071033","userName":"daffy1108","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41024833","version":"1.164.0","score":1,"title":"Deleted benefit feature","text":"With latest update this fun game is no longer fun or challenging.
